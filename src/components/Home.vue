            <h2>Hi!</h2>

            <p>
              I'm Jessica. I'm a freshman attending Duke University. I really like pink fluffy unicorns and baby zebras.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm currently a global health major and am looking forward to a life of unemployment. It's so exciting!
            </p>

            <p>
              My favorite food is garlic. In case you are a recruiter for a company, please please please reach out to
              me. You'll totally not ever regret it.
            </p>

              Zebras are really cool.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to my love of garlic, I really enjoy a good plate of fries only made from potatoes not
              sweet potatoes.
